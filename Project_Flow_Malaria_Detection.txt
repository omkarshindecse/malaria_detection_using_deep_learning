Project Flow for Malaria Detection Using Deep Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system to automatically detect malaria from microscopic blood smear images. The system follows a structured workflow from dataset collection to deployment.
________________________________________
Step 1: Dataset Collection
•	Download the NIH Malaria Dataset from Kaggle or NIH repository.
•	The dataset contains two classes:
o	Parasitized (Infected cells)
o	Uninfected (Healthy cells)
•	Extract and store the dataset in the project directory.
________________________________________
Step 2: Dataset Organization
Organize the dataset into training and validation folders.
Structure:
dataset/
 train/
  Parasitized/
  Uninfected/
 validation/
  Parasitized/
  Uninfected/
Split Ratio:
•	80% Training Data
•	20% Validation Data
Purpose:
•	Training data is used to train the model.
•	Validation data is used to evaluate performance.
________________________________________
Step 3: Data Pre-processing
Preprocessing is performed to prepare images for model training.
Steps:
•	Resize images to 224 × 224 pixels
•	Normalize pixel values (scale between 0 and 1)
•	Apply data augmentation:
o	Rotation
o	Zoom
o	Horizontal flip
o	Brightness adjustment
Purpose:
•	Improve model accuracy
•	Prevent overfitting
•	Increase dataset diversity

Step 4: Data Visualization
Visualize the dataset and model performance.
Tasks:
•	Display sample images from both classes
•	Check class distribution
•	Plot training and validation accuracy graphs
•	Plot loss graphs
•	Generate confusion matrix
•	Plot ROC curve
Tools used:
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn

Step 5: Model Building
Develop deep learning models for classification.
Models Used:
•	Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
•	Transfer Learning Models:
o	MobileNetV2
o	EfficientNetB0
Output:
•	Binary classification (Parasitized / Uninfected)
________________________________________
Step 6: Model Training
•	Train models using training dataset
•	Use Binary Crossentropy loss function
•	Use Adam optimizer
•	Train for multiple epochs (10–25)
•	Apply early stopping and parameter tuning
________________________________________
Step 7: Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using validation dataset.
Metrics:
•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	F1 Score
•	ROC-AUC
•	Confusion Matrix
Select the best-performing model based on these metrics.
________________________________________
Step 8: Save the Model
Save the trained model for future use.
Example:
model.save("malaria_model.h5")
Purpose:
•	Avoid retraining
•	Use for prediction and deployment
________________________________________
Step 9: Prediction Module
Develop a module to:
•	Load the saved model
•	Accept a new image
•	Preprocess the image
•	Predict:
o	Parasitized or Uninfected
•	Display confidence score
________________________________________
Step 10: Application Development
Create a simple web interface using Streamlit.
Features:
•	Upload blood smear image
•	Display uploaded image
•	Show prediction result
•	Show confidence percentage
________________________________________
Step 11: Testing
Test the system in real-world scenarios:
•	Rural clinic screening
•	Hospital mass screening
•	Research analysis
________________________________________
Step 12: Deployment
Deploy the application:
•	Streamlit Cloud or Local Deployment
Benefits:
•	Fast detection
•	Automated diagnosis
•	Useful in remote areas
