# malaria_detection_using_deep_learning

Project Overview

Malaria is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Early and accurate detection of malaria parasites is essential for effective treatment and disease control.

Traditional microscopic examination of blood smears is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires expert pathologists. This project uses Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning, to automatically detect malaria from microscopic blood smear images.

The system classifies blood cell images into:

Parasitized (Infected)

Uninfected (Healthy)

This solution helps in fast, accurate, and automated malaria detection, especially useful for rural and resource-limited areas.
