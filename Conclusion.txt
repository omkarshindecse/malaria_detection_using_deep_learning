Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of Deep Learning techniques for the automated detection of malaria from microscopic blood smear images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to classify blood cell images into two categories: Parasitized and Uninfected.

The system includes complete steps such as dataset collection, preprocessing, data visualization, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment through a user-friendly application. The trained model achieved good accuracy and was able to identify malaria-infected cells effectively.

By automating the detection process, this system helps reduce manual effort, minimizes human error, and provides faster diagnosis. The developed application allows users to upload images and receive predictions along with confidence scores, making it practical for real-world usage.

This solution can support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, especially in rural and resource-limited areas where expert pathologists may not be available. Overall, the project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning can be applied in the healthcare domain to improve disease detection and assist medical decision-making.
